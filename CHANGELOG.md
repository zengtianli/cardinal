# Changelog

## Unreleased (fork `feat/search-history`)
- Persist committed search queries across restarts (`localStorage` key `cardinal.recentSearches`, newest first, deduplicated, capped at 50).
- Record a query on `Enter` in the search bar and on any result open (double-click / `Cmd+O` / context menu).
- Add a search-history dropdown to the search bar: click an entry to re-run it, `Clear history` to empty the list, `Esc`/outside click to close.
- Localize the new strings (`search.history.*`) across all 15 bundled languages.
- Upstream PR: <https://github.com/cardisoft/cardinal/pull/222> (open).
